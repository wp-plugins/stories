## Bryan Monzon Boilerplate Plugin
==========

This is a boiler plate plugin for WordPress. It is based on the needs at Bryan Monzon and isn't necassarily intended for others to use. We've found that we do a lot of things over and over again and rebuilding these things from scratch is a lot of work. 

Although you can certainly install this plugin and it will work, it will be useless as everything referenced as "Boiler"

### What's included?

- Creates a Post Type
- Creates Taxonomies
- Provides constants for disabling archives, changing labels and post type slugs (and taxonomies)
- Template settings page
- Metabox template

### Getting Started

I recommend using Sublime Text 2 or 3. When finding and replacing the words below, make sure you have *case sensitive* enabled.

1. Find and replace `boiler` with something different from what's already in our repository
1. Find and replace `BOILER` with something different. *Make sure to use all caps when you replace*
1. Find and replace `Boiler`. This will appear in the title and description.

If you dig around in the code base, you'll see where you can and can't change things. Again, this is just a basic starting point for our internal projects. Create an issue if you see anything that needs to be added to this plugin.
